## Flying in the Red Bull Douglas DC-6B | The Flying Bulls
November 2019 - Salzburg, Austria 🇦🇹
Without a doubt, the DC-6B is the crown jewel of the Flying Bulls. Built-in 1958, the plane has had an illustrious past. She was used to chauffeuring heads of state and their celebrity guests all over the world. The sheer size and the unmistakable 1950s coat of the DC-6B are as impressive as ever.

I had the pleasure to have a ride on this plane, it was awesome!

## 24 Hour Hitchhike Challenge - Yes Theory Editor Application
June 2018 - Sheffield, England 🇬🇧
This was my application to work as Yes Theory's badass Storyteller and  Editor. The assignment was to make where you put yourself out of your comfort zone. Even though I was in the middle of my university final exams, I couldn't pass up such an amazing opportunity.

Therefore, I decided to document myself seeking discomfort by trying to hitchhike home and surprise my mum - filming and editing the process within 24 hours. All in time for one of my exams the next day.
