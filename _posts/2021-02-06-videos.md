## Flying in the Red Bull Douglas DC-6B | The Flying Bulls
<small>November 2019 - Salzburg, Austria 🇦🇹</small>

Without a doubt, the DC-6B is the crown jewel of the Flying Bulls. Built-in 1958, the plane has had an illustrious past. She was used to chauffeuring heads of state and their celebrity guests all over the world. The sheer size and the unmistakable 1950s coat of the DC-6B are as impressive as ever.

I had the pleasure to have a ride on this plane, it was awesome!

## 24 Hour Hitchhike Challenge - Yes Theory Editor Application
<small>June 2018 - Sheffield, England 🇬🇧</small>

This was my application to work as Yes Theory's badass Storyteller and  Editor. The assignment was to make where you put yourself out of your comfort zone. Even though I was in the middle of my university final exams, I couldn't pass up such an amazing opportunity.

Therefore, I decided to document myself seeking discomfort by trying to hitchhike home and surprise my mum - filming and editing the process within 24 hours. All in time for one of my exams the next day.

## Vietnam Tour
<small>July 2017 - Vietnam 🇻🇳 </small>

Summer 2017, my friend [Seb](https://www.instagram.com/seb_langmead/){:target="_blank"} and I embarked on a little trip to Asia! We flew from London, U.K to Hong Kong and spent 5 days exploring there. Next, we flew from Hong Kong to Hanoi, (north) Vietnam. We had a month to explore Vietnam and it's neighbouring countries. When the month was up, we flew from Ho Chi Minh City, (south) Vietnam back home to London. The next day, my friend joined the crew and we flew to Helsinki, Finland for a festival... but that's whole other adventure...

Below is a playlist of all my Asia uploads.

## Hitchhike - Sheffield, UK 🇬🇧 to Riga, Latvia 🇱🇻

<small>April 2017 - UK 🇬🇧, Netherlands 🇳🇱, Germany 🇩🇪, Poland 🇵🇱, Lithuania 🇱🇹 and Latvia 🇱🇻 </small>

April 2017, I went hitchhiking across Europe with my two friends, Chris and Caitlin.

We hitchhiked in 23 different rides, covering 1860 miles, from Sheffield, United Kingdom to Riga, Latvia. We raised £805 for charity along the way.

Below is a playlist of the Snapchat footage from the 9 days we were travelling, starting with the summary video.
