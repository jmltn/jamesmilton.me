GetSafeOnline aims to be the UK’s leading information resource for helping protect people, finances, devices and businesses from online fraud and abuse. Their website contains a variety of videos about staying safe online, from how to safely perform a computer backup, to gaming and dating online.

However, GetSafeOnline’s content has been labelled an “expensive flop”, as collectively they cost more than £12 million to design and develop, but there have only been viewed 1.9 million times across 2 years and 10 months.

Myself and my team recreated the videos into motion graphics, developed in Adobe Illustrator and After Effects, in order to make the content more accessible, innovative, user-friendly and making it an attractive way to increase knowledge on shopping safely online.

(Video narrating done by me 😬)
